# Neural-Network-Training-for-Latin-Letter-Recognition-from-Hand-Movements
In this task, we plan to train a neural network to recognize Latin letters according to human hand movements.
Two csv files are placed for training and testing. The first column in each file shows the label of that line, and the next 784 columns show the pixel values of each image. The label of each class is such that the number 0 is equivalent to class A, the number 1 is equivalent to class B, and in the same way, the number 24 is equivalent to class Y.
The training has been done using ADAM and SGD algorithms and the difference between these two algorithms has been investigated.
