# Neural-Network-Training-for-Latin-Letter-Recognition-from-Hand-Movements
In this task, we plan to train a neural network to recognize Latin letters according to human hand movements.
Two CSV files have been used for training and testing.
The training has been done using ADAM and SGD algorithms and the difference between these two algorithms has been investigated.
